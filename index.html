            <h1>Fire Emblem Echoes: Shadows of Valentia retains and updates many mechanics that originated in Fire Emblem Gaiden. Among these include a navigable world map, as well as freely explorable towns and dungeons. Such exploration takes place from a third-person behind-the-back perspective, and when an enemy is encountered during exploration, the game transitions to a traditional Fire Emblem tactical battle. If the player can preemptively strike the enemy icon in the dungeon to start the battle, the enemy units will begin the fight with a slight reduction to their HP and their starting positions will be closer to the enemy. Echoes also retains the unique battle system used in Gaiden, making map battles much different from other Fire Emblem titles.</h1>
